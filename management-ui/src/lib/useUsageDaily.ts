   useUsageDaily — one day's usage report.

   The TopBar picker and the Overview breakdown both call this with the same day,
   and useManagementQuery keys on the path, so they share a single cache entry and
   a single network request rather than each fetching their own copy.

   The response carries both the day's totals and the available-day bounds
   (earliestDay / latestDay / availableDays), which is why the picker does not
   need a separate index request.
